```

Or, if using Bundler, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this. This gem was created just because I wanted to use Open AI's swarm framework in Ruby. There is likly a ton of 🍌s code in this repo since I relied heavily on LLMs to create this gem in < 2 days.

It needs more testing, documentation clean up and expantion on the examples to parity the Open AI's [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) library.
